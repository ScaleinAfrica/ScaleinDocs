## Setup & Installation

### Pre-requisite Technologies

| Technology  | Notes       | Required/Optional |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [**Node JS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)          | Core javascript runtime that all code-based microservices are run on. It is suggested that you **install a node version manager** that allows you to switch between various node versions with ease. | **Required** |
| [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) | Containerisation technology on which we will run microservice architecture locally  | **Required**        |
| [**Docker-Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  | Technology that will allow us to define all microservices and run them together with one command      | **Required**        |
| [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com)             | Main IDE used for software development, however, use whatever IDE you are most comfortable with | *Optional*        |
| [**MongoDB Compass**](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) | To be used to manage and manipulate database collections and documents manually for the main app (*database data*)   | **Required**    |
| [**DBeaver**](https://dbeaver.io)  | Used to connect to and manipulate a user and authentication data in a Postgres database (managed by Supertokens) | *Optional* |

  <br />

| Repository  | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| [**Scalein User Frontend**](https://github.com/ScaleIn/SIUserPortal) | This repository contains the code for the **talent** and **business** web application. This is the main application that users will interact with via the web browser|
| [**Auth Service**](https://github.com/ScaleinAfrica/AuthService) | This repository hosts the code for the (REST) authentication service. The authentication service **handles all matters pertaining to user authentication across all microservices** |
| [**API Layer**](https://github.com/ScaleIn/ScaleInAPILayer) | This microservice **was** meant to act as a monolith. ***But this will being phased out over time*** in favour of a **microservice architecture**. In the interim however, most of our server-side API endpoints will be found within the **API Layer** |
| [**Email Service**](https://github.com/ScaleinAfrica/EmailService) | This service hosts the code for the (REST) email service. The email service will **handle specific use cases where automated** (and templated) emails need to be sent to specific individuals |
| [**Matching Engine**](https://github.com/ScaleIn/MatchingEngine) | The matching engine is a microservice that has one primary responsibility: **To select/choose the best candidates (Scalein talent) for a business**, based on the business' requirements |
| [**Scalein Core**](https://github.com/ScaleIn/SI-Core) | The Scalein Core repository **holds the docker-compose configuration** that will allow you to run all the microservices at once via docker containers. It is **thus, the core repository that empowers your local development**|

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
