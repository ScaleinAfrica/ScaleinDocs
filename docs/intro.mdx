# Getting Started

  :::tip Info
    This page was created to help you get started with running the app and
    developing it in a **local (development) environment**.

## Setup & Installation

### Pre-requisite Technologies

| Technology  | Notes       | Required/Optional |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| [**Node JS**](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)          | Core javascript runtime that all code-based microservices are run on| **Required** |
| [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/desktop) | Containerisation technology on which we will run microservice architecture locally  | **Required**        |
| [**Docker-Compose**](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)  | Technology that will allow us to define all microservices and run them together with one command      | **Required**        |
| [**VSCode**](https://code.visualstudio.com)             | Main IDE used for software development, however, use whatever IDE you are most comfortable with | *Optional*        |
| [**MongoDB Compass**](https://www.mongodb.com/products/tools/compass) | To be used to manage and manipulate database collections and documents manually for the main app (*database data*)   | **Required**    |
| [**DBeaver**](https://dbeaver.io)  | Used to connect to and manipulate a user and authentication data in a Postgres database (managed by Supertokens) | *Optional* |


## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**.

The classic template will automatically be added to your project after you run the command:

```bash
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

You can type this command into Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, or any other integrated terminal of your code editor.

The command also installs all necessary dependencies you need to run Docusaurus.

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```bash
cd my-website
npm run start
```

The `cd` command changes the directory you're working with. In order to work with your newly created Docusaurus site, you'll need to navigate the terminal there.

The `npm run start` command builds your website locally and serves it through a development server, ready for you to view at http://localhost:3000/.

Open `docs/intro.md` (this page) and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
